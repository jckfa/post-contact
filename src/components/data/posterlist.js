    description: `
      <p>I’m not sure if this is what people need right now, but I saw a video circulating online of an older white woman saying “it was just one person” in response to the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests. If I could show her now, this would be my response — 100 Names and Faces of Black People Killed by Police.</p>

      <p>Consider that 104 unarmed black people were killed by police in the US in 2015 alone — and their stories are only the wrongful deaths that were documented. One person should have been enough, but it’s not “just one person.” Police brutality is pervasive against black men, women, trans-persons (Mya Hall & Tony McDade), children (Tamir Rice & Aiyana Jones), elderly, able-bodied, and differently-abled (Jeremy McDole). Since cops don’t discriminate along those lines, the obvious factor is... RACE! Police that do not directly act out their racism are still complicit with their buddies that are (i.e. the 3 other cops) and the racist system that the Police Force was founded on. Cops do not serve the people unless they serve all of the people. Cops do not protect the people unless they protect all of the people. Defund and abolish the racist, murdering, and complicit cops. Fuck the Police. and SAY THEIR NAMES!</p>

    description: `<p>COVID-19 has exposed an inherent instability in the way we were carrying on — not just in the bad, but in the good, too. Instability in the little things. Networks, spaces and institutions that we thought were sound were actually frayed, subject now to atrophy like useless limbs. Much of what we took for granted is already lounging in ruin.</p>

    <p>As artists and designers, we are confronted with picking what to mend — how to we sift through and decide what to restore? For me, past a certain point, a lot of it is still in question. Do I even want to return to New York? Do I want to continue making the work I've been doing? How do we shoulder the responsibility of moving forward most equitably? Right now, unfortunately, there are still more q's than answers, more unconnected points than lines.</p>`,

    description: `<p>A temporary poster 1,394 miles away from me sounds appropriate right now. Yesterday my co-workers and I were informed that one of us had tested positive for COVID, a first at our store. Everything is still business as usual. We are sad people with winning smiles. I seem to not be able to feel or react strongly anymore after being exhausted from constant news and information and rare anger toward the incompetencies surrounding this situation and for all of those left unsupported.</p>

    <p>Everyday feels the same, yet things are always changing, and things are changing so quickly, yet it feels we are acting slowly. It’s hard to process, to find the right words. The outline of the feeling is there, but it’s not fully formed. People often jokingly say that adults don’t know what they’re doing. I wish that wasn’t so broadly true. I don’t know if that sequence of thoughts made any sense, but I guess that’s okay right now. Anyway here’s my poster.</p>`
