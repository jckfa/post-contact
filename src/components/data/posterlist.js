      <p>
        After scrolling and exploring Instagram too much in the past weeks I noticed that many influencers use similar poses. I became curious about what these say about our time, culture, and the power they hold. I decided to look closer, but narrowed my search to the top-follwed fashion influencers.
      </p>

      <p>
        After collecting the most common poses I recontextualized them myself. I did so by photographing myself in some of the most common poses without backgrounds, color, and minimal clothing (all black). This gave me an absurd overview of the prevalent body language and expressions used by top Instagram fashion influencers. They are the ones who arguably hold the power to influence and have a prominent role in body representation and identity expression. It has become a strange and humorous in-progress reconstruction of body positioning that I plan to continue to explore and ideate from in future research. At this point it reveals more questions than answers. And some interesting potential.

No matter how high and far you go up the social ladder if the hierarchy is still in place, and the hierarchy is not being interrogated, called into question, and called for transformation, then you’re just making those at the top more colorful and reinforcing the same kind of hierarchy that was doing you in when you were at the bottom.”

        "My philosophy with postering is that if you integrate it in a way that's tasteful—you know I guess that's subjective, to me it's just common sense... if a building is abandoned and it's in a condition where they're going to have to put work into it as soon as someone occupies it anyway then I don't feel like I'm lowering the property value or making anyone's life unreasonably miserable. And then, as far as city property goes, I look at it like I'm a tax payer and as long as I'm not covering a stop sign—so someone runs a stop sign and gets killed—you know, that if I use the back of the sign or an electrical box that that's a legitimate use of the public space. [...] I've always emphasized the reclamation of public space as a forum for free speech."

        There are many variations of this graphic swimming around but this version is based on <a href='https://flic.kr/p/Mjphvj' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>a Dutch version</a> that was painted on a giant banner and affixed to the side of a building in Brussels. As far as I know that version dates back to 2017 and was done by an anonymous artist or artists. But the concept is not new—it stems from the classical proverb “big fish eat little fish.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1975 British political artist <a href='http://www.kenspraguefund.org/about.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ken Sprague</a> did a two sequence cartoon called <span><a href='https://twitter.com/jckfa/status/1274455220303663105/photo/1' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>The Parable of the Fishes</a></span>. It was based on the children’s book <span><a href='https://bookcandy.typepad.com/files/swimmy-by-leo-lionni.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Swimmy (1963)</a></span> by Dutch author and illustrator <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Lionni' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Leo Lionni</a>. And, according to <span><a href='https://t.co/p3wfsxUn65?amp=1' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Tradition and Innovation in Folk Literature (2015)</a></span> by Wolfgang Mieder, as early as 1858 German paremiographer Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander wrote, ‘"Big fish eat little," at least as long as the latter let themselves be eaten, and until they come up with the idea of joining together and eating the large ones.'

      <p>I’m not sure if this is what people need right now, but I saw a video circulating online of an older white woman saying “it was just one person” in response to the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests. If I could show her now, this would be my response — 100 Names and Faces of Black People Killed by Police.</p>

      <p>Consider that 104 unarmed black people were killed by police in the US in 2015 alone — and their stories are only the wrongful deaths that were documented. One person should have been enough, but it’s not “just one person.” Police brutality is pervasive against black men, women, trans-persons (Mya Hall & Tony McDade), children (Tamir Rice & Aiyana Jones), elderly, able-bodied, and differently-abled (Jeremy McDole). Since cops don’t discriminate along those lines, the obvious factor is... RACE! Police that do not directly act out their racism are still complicit with their buddies that are (i.e. the 3 other cops) and the racist system that the Police Force was founded on. Cops do not serve the people unless they serve all of the people. Cops do not protect the people unless they protect all of the people. Defund and abolish the racist, murdering, and complicit cops. Fuck the Police. and SAY THEIR NAMES!</p>

Networks, spaces and institutions that we thought were sound were actually frayed, subject now to atrophy like useless limbs. Much of what we took for granted is already lounging in ruin.</p>

    <p>As artists and designers, we are confronted with picking what to mend — how to we sift through and decide what to restore? For me, past a certain point, a lot of it is still in question. Do I even want to return to New York? Do I want to continue making the work I've been doing? How do we shoulder the responsibility of moving forward most equitably? Right now, unfortunately, there are still more q's than answers, more unconnected points than lines.</p>`,

Yesterday my co-workers and I were informed that one of us had tested positive for COVID, a first at our store. Everything is still business as usual. We are sad people with winning smiles. I seem to not be able to feel or react strongly anymore after being exhausted from constant news and information and rare anger toward the incompetencies surrounding this situation and for all of those left unsupported.</p>

    <p>Everyday feels the same, yet things are always changing, and things are changing so quickly, yet it feels we are acting slowly. It’s hard to process, to find the right words. The outline of the feeling is there, but it’s not fully formed. People often jokingly say that adults don’t know what they’re doing. I wish that wasn’t so broadly true. I don’t know if that sequence of thoughts made any sense, but I guess that’s okay right now. Anyway here’s my poster.</p>`

Portrayed here are stills from the first dance to Edith Piaf’s <span>Non, Je ne regrette rien</span>. A joyful uplifting moment amidst our current haze of unknowns.`
